Description: Export Rcmdr output to LaTeX or HTML code. The
        plug-in was originally intended to facilitate exporting Rcmdr
        output to formats other than ASCII text and to provide R
        novices with an easy-to-use, easy-to-access reference on
        exporting R objects to formats suited for printed output. The
        package documentation contains several pointers on creating
        reports, either by using conventional word processors or
        LaTeX/LyX.
